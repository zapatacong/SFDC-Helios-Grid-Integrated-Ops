## 🏗️ System Architecture
The Helios Grid Performance suite is a modularized solution designed to bridge the gap between physical solar hardware and field service operations.

### 1. Module: Sentinel (Compliance & Data Integrity)
* **Purpose:** Enforces business-critical data rules at the database level.
* **Technical Implementation:** Apex Triggers and a custom "Permit Status" logic.
* **Outcome:** Prevents modification of assets at sites with expired permits, ensuring 100% regulatory compliance.

### 2. Module: Volt-Track (IoT Ingress & Automation)
* **Purpose:** Processes real-time efficiency data from solar inverters.
* **Technical Implementation:** * **Apex REST API:** Secure endpoint for external hardware to "PATCH" efficiency data using **External IDs**.
    * **Batch Apex:** Asynchronous processing of large asset volumes to identify performance drops.
    * **Scheduled Apex:** Nightly automation that generates **Work Orders** for any inverter performing below 80% efficiency.

### 3. Module: Bright-Spark (Real-Time Visualization)
* **Purpose:** Provides a high-impact UI for technicians to monitor inverter health.
* **Technical Implementation:** **Lightning Web Component (LWC)** utilizing the `@wire` service for reactive data updates.
* **Outcome:** A color-coded health gauge (Green/Yellow/Red) that dynamically updates as IoT data flows into the system.

## 🛠️ Technical Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Metadata Mismatch** | Resolved deployment failures between Scratch and Dev Orgs by pruning unnecessary Asset metadata and planning an **Org Shape** strategy. |
| **Scalability** | Prevented Governor Limit hits by shifting heavy calculations from Triggers to an **Asynchronous Batch Apex** engine. |
